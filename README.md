# Recommendation-Engines
Movies Recommendation Engine

We were given movies and ratings datasets in order to create a recommendation-engine.

Compared several algorithms (KNNBasic, KNNWithMeans, KNNWithZScore) and tweaking their hyperparameters to identify which is the most efficient.

Created a content-based algorithm using the content and descriptions of the products/items. In the case of films we can use the tags, genres, year of production, etc. to predict the rating of a user u to an item i.

FYI, the 'genome-scores.csv' that you can see in the content-based part is too heavy to be uploaded on GitHub (420MB, 75 compressed).
